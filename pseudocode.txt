Show droplet
Have line of white light intersecting droplet
find intersection point and angle
find first internal refraction lines for each wavelength
for each refraction line:
	find intersect point and angle on droplet
	produce 2 lines, 1 refracting outwards, 1 reflecting, each with calculated intensity
	for each internal reflection line
